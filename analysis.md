# 2023: Quarter 3 (July - September) Citi Bike Data Analysis

## Membership Analysis

**Monthly Distribution:** The high percentage of members in Quarter 3 suggests that there might be benefits for becoming a member. Such benefits could include lower pricing per ride or promotions.

**Average Distance**:
Casual riders traveled slightly farther on average for bike rides that are more than 1 mile. This could be because casual riders may use the service for recreational or longer trips, while members might use it for daily commuting or short-distance trips.

**Bike Type Usage:** The majority of riders preferring classic bikes might be due to the bikes' reliability, simplicity, and familiarity. 

**Duration of Ride:** The greater range and IQR for members' ride durations could be attributed to various factors. Members might use the service for a broader range of purposes, including longer leisure rides and daily commuting. In contrast, casual riders may have more consistent, shorter rides. Additionally, the wider variation in members' ride durations could reflect differences in riding habits and objectives, with some members taking longer trips while others opt for shorter, daily rides.

## Time Duration Analysis

**Distance Distribution:** The observation of the widest range and highest interquartile range for rides in the 1-5 miles range suggests that this is a segment with significant ride duration variation. This could be because these rides are more diverse in terms of purpose, including both leisure rides and longer commutes. Riders in this category might have varying speeds and stops along their routes, leading to a broader range of ride durations. Additionally, the presence of outliers across all distances may indicate that there are exceptional circumstances, such as unexpected stops, route detours, or technical issues, that occasionally lead to significantly longer or shorter ride durations. It's also possible that some riders may not lock their bikes properly at the end of the ride, leading to unintentional extensions of ride duration.

**Time Duration Distribution:** The concentration of rides within the 0-15-minute range indicates that a substantial portion of the user base employs the bike-sharing service for quick, short trips. These rides are likely used for tasks like running errands, short commutes, or leisure rides around the neighborhood. The high percentage (45%) of rides lasting less than 5 minutes within the short ride duration category suggests that a significant number of users are using the service for very brief, possibly point-to-point journeys.

**Bike Type Usage:** As with the bike type usage analysis regarding membership, the preference for classic bikes over electric bikes might be due to factors such as familiarity, accessibility, and lower pricing. Classic bikes are typically more widely available and may be the default option for many riders.

## Month and Time Analysis

**Monthly Distribution:** In July 2023, the total number of rides amounted to approximately 106,000. This indicates the level of demand and utilization of the bike-sharing service during the peak summer season when more people are likely to explore the city. August saw a noticeable increase in ride activity, with approximately 112,000 rides. This 5% increase from July suggests that there was a growing demand for the service during the summer, possibly due to more tourists, favorable weather, or special events that attracted riders. In September, there was a decrease in the number of rides, with roughly 94,000 rides. This 15% decrease from August to September could be attributed to the end of the summer season, a return to school and work routines, or changing weather conditions.

**Peak Hours:** The data shows that the peak hours for ride starts were at 8 am and during the evening hours, specifically from 6 to 7 pm. These hours likely align with typical commuting patterns and recreational activities in the city. At 8 am, riders might be using the service for their daily commute to work or school. In the evening, especially from 6 to 7 pm, riders might be using the service for leisurely rides or for returning home after work.

## Start and End Stations Analysis
